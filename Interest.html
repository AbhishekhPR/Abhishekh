								<p> I would describe myself as highly curious and focused on learning, personal and professional, in all parts of life. I look for the hardest problems to solve and where I can learn and develop the most in my professional life. The fact that you are part of the process and play an important role in Business Transformation through gathering requirements or modelling processes gives fulfilment.</p>
									<p>When I initially started college I was really into coding which made me want to learn everything on how to build things and solve complex problems. I knew I had a passion for finding solutions and understanding how things work, which made me believe that IT career would be ideal for me, especially that I have a solid background in math and coding. However, as I started attending classes, I noticed that I am less interested in highly technical engineering classes, and more interested in classes related to organizations operations, business processes improvement, and business analysis. That interest was confirmed when I went deep into it, where I gained valuable knowledge in technology business analysis.</p>
                                        <p>Conducting system analyses on software applications, programmes, and web services are among the responsibilities of a technical business analyst. coordinating with internal departments and end users to ascertain the effectiveness and usefulness of the system. submitting an application for system development projects to management and receiving permission. integrating new systems, software, and applications successfully into existing operations and services. examining and enhancing the effectiveness of customer care and customer portal websites. ensuring end-user competency across departments with new systems, programmes, and applications. monitoring product licencing and guaranteeing adherence to rules set forth by the IT sector. ensuring that system upgrades and enhancements are compatible with computer hardware. combining performance metrics and encryption to increase system security and efficiency. putting recent developments in system and enterprise architecture into practise.</p>
