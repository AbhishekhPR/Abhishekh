								<p> I have numerous abilities to share, but first and foremost, while learning any subject or topic, it is always best to follow a proper methodology. There are many ways to learn new skills, but here I'll be showing you how I've progressed over time. </p>
								<p> Consistensey is the key. Eliminating distractions so you can focus on what you are learning. Organize the facts you're learning so it's easier to recall. When working, use elaborative rehearsal by spending a few moments articulating anything new to yourself in your own words. Have you ever questioned yourself, "What about my job do I enjoy the most/least?" That's easy; First try to find the job that suits you, look up different career option online, and simply attempt to bring out the best in yourself in anything you want to do. If you're curious about mine, this is how I become an expert at what I do. </p>
								<p>An analyst is any person who performs business analysis tasks, no matter their job title or organizational role.</p>
								
								<a>Basics: </a><br><br>

								<li>Problem Solving: You must fully comprehend the issue at hand, analyse it from many angles, take into account various restrictions, and then offer both viable and alternate solutions. This necessitates the use of methods like brainstorming, Five Whys to reach to the main point of the problem and come up with the solution.<br><Br></li>
								<li>Communication: There are several modes of communication in an organisation like emails, documents, meetings, skype calls, video conferencing, chats and many more. Thus, you need to be clear, expressive, concise in the communication. An effective communication also involves active listening to understand what is being told.<br><br></li>
								<li>Management Skill: You must be in charge of many duties, including gathering requirements, obtaining approvals, documenting, testing, attending meetings, performing some ad hoc work, and overseeing the entire project. To balance the activities and deadlines, it is crucial for you to develop management skills.<br><br></li>
								<li>Research: The fact that you are a problem solver and you dig into problems to recommend solutions, itself makes it self-explanatory that research is one of the important skillsets for an analyst.<br><br></li>

								<a>Technical Skills: </a><br><br>

								<p>The best way to learn programming is to work on projects while studying a programming language and DSA side by side to see how everything fits together. If you have the patience, start learning a language like C; if not, start learning something with a simpler syntax, like JavaScript, and pick up DSA on the side. The ability to directly manipulate data at the computer architectural level provided by assembly language will be a great addition to your toolkit and be useful in situations like exploit development or even occasionally when performing reverse engineering.</p>

                                <li>Knowledge of IT skills:  Acting as a bridge between developers and clients,you are expected to be technically sound and should be aware of various IT areas such as Database, programming languages, office suite, operating systems, testing environment in the market.</li><br>
                                <li>Domain Knowledge:  A programmer must be informed of the domain he works in and be aware about the business case of the project in order to solve domain specific problem.</li><br><br>
